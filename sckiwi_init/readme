This is how you can run both main codes in Seiscomp3 as modules!
Tips:
1- modify line 3 in both python codes and set the proper paths.
2- put the codes in $SEISCOMP_HOME/etc/init dir
3- start the scconfig and there you go :))  you can start your modules (e.g. sckiwi_ki & sckiwi_sc).

Point:
1- Be aware that none-absolute paths in both main Bash codes (e.g. Data_Provider and Source_Analysis)
can cause some problems in their functionality. Try to alter them as absolute paths.

For example:
seiscomp exec scbulletin -E $EVID -3 -d mysql://sysop:sysop@"$HOST"/seiscomp3 > .EVE_INFO.txt
 
this line should be like:

seiscomp exec scbulletin -E $EVID -3 -d mysql://sysop:sysop@"$HOST"/seiscomp3 > $KIWI_HOME/.EVE_INFO.txt

2- Both Bash codes will be run in background so "echo" functions are useless in both cases.

fell free Letting me know if you interupted by any problems ;)
